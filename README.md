Inventory WebApp

This is a web application that I had made to showcase my abilities in managing a MongoDB database through a web browser. This web application uses BootStrap, Express.js, node.js, and MongoDB.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Check to make sure MongoDB is open on the default port (27017)
- Make sure the dependencies for this project had been installed beforehand
- To run this program, open a terminal to the "inventory-webapp" directory, and enter "node server.js". This will first start connecting to the default address to your local mongodb server, and will create a collection if it doesn't already exist on the database (and will create the "inventory" database if it wasn't created yet). Once that it done, the program will attempt to open a locally-hosted webpage on your default browser.
